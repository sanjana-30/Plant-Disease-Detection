# Plant-Disease-Detection

In recent years, the agricultural sector has witnessed a surge in the development and
application of advanced technologies to mitigate the detrimental effects of plant
diseases. Among these technologies, deep learning-based approaches have shown
promising results due to their ability to learn intricate patterns from large-scale data.
In this study, we present a comparative analysis of four prominent deep learning
architectures, namely CNN, DenseNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3 for the task of plant disease detection.
Each architecture is evaluated using a comprehensive dataset comprising images of
tomato leaf affected by different diseases. Through extensive experimentation, we
assess the performance of each model in terms of accuracy. Results indicate that each
architecture exhibits unique strengths and weaknesses, with some excelling in
accuracy while others demonstrate superior computational efficiency.
Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the comparative performance of
deep learning architectures.

I have considered only Tomato leaf dataset for this project. You can find the entire dataset in the above link.



Files:
Plant_Disease_detection_model.inpyb: This file contains comparitive analysis between the CNN, DenseNet, MobileNet, and InceptionV3 architecture. 
Plantdisease_prediction.inpyb: This file contains code for predicting plant disease by uploading image link. The prediction is made using InceptionV3. InceptionV3 is used as the prediction model due to its high accuracy than rest of the models as in comparitive analysis.
